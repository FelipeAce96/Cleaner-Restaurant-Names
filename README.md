# Cleaner-Restaurant-Names üçî
Fine tuned model (T5-Google) for clean restaurant names (remove address and stow words automatically) [Spanish]

Given a dataset of inputs (regular name) and outputs (cleaned name) train a sequence to sequence model to learn how to clean names.

## The Model is Saved in Huggingface ü§ó

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("felipeace96/cleaner-restaurant-names")
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained("felipeace96/cleaner-restaurant-names")     
```
